# CNN OpenCV CUDA GPU support with Greedy Sparse Autoencoder 
# Convolution-Deep-Neural-Network-with-Sparse-Autoencoder-and-Reinforcement-Learning
Under development Autoencoder tested now, Sparse Greedy Denoiseing tested. Just a place to store my code under develop the code until finish.
When finish it will be placed here.

Dependency:
NVIDIA CUDA to be able to run on GPU
OpenCV (Will use computation on GPU, to be continued)

Compile:

$make

Run:

$./OW_CNN_R

Installation.


Input image is eather from input.JPG or CIFAR-10 depending on Y/N start question. 
CIFAR-10 data set as image input testing. 
To do that download "CIFAR-10 binary version (suitable for C programs)" dataset from
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
Extract and put data_batch_1.bin in same place as the program.
